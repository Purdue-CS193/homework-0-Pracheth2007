# Pracheth's First CS193 HomeWork

## A few things I like about CS193:
- Hands-on projects that actually produce an app you can run on a phone or simulator.
- Learning design patterns and architecture that make apps easier to maintain and scale.
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Peer collaboration and sharing different ways to solve the same problem.

    <h1>Pracheth Gullapalli's First CS193 Homework</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>A few things I like about CS193:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hands-on projects that actually produce an app you can run on a phone or simulator.</li>
      <li>Learning design patterns and architecture that make apps easier to maintain and scale.</li>
      <li>Debugging and problem-solving</li>
      <li>Peer collaboration and sharing different ways to solve the same problem.</li>
    </ul>
